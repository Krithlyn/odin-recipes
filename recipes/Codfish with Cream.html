<h1>Codfish with Cream</h1>
    <img src="../images/codfish.jpg">
    
<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This a traditional Portuguese way of cooking codfish, from the capital city of Lisbon. 
        In a country with a large tradition of making codfish in several ways, this is, for me, the most delicious and sinful way of eating this wonderful fish. 
        Taste it and you will see! </p>
    
        
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ol>
    <li>12 ounces dried salted cod fish </li>
    <li>vegetable oil for frying </li>
    <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and cut into very small cubes </li>
    <li>½ cup olive oil </li>
    <li>1 large onion, sliced thin </li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour </li>
    <li>1 cup hot milk </li>
    <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg </li>
    <li>1/⅓ cups heavy cream </li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
    <li>⅔ cup heavy cream </li>
    <li>1 ounce grated Parmesan cheese </li>
</ol>

<h4>Directions</h4>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
<p>Soak the dried salted cod in cold water with the skin side up for 24 hours, 
    changing the water about 4 times. 
    Drain and discard the water.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>

<p>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>

<p>Place the cod in a pan with enough water to cover; bring to a boil and cook for 10 minutes. 
    Remove the cod from the pan; remove and discard the skin and bones. 
    Cut the cod into chunks and set aside.
</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>

<p>Heat 1/2 inch vegetable oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches if necessary, fry the potatoes in the hot oil until just cooked, about 5 minutes. 
    Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain.</p>


<p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>


<p>Pour the olive oil into a Dutch oven or heat-proof casserole dish over medium heat. 
    Cook the onion and garlic in the oil until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. 
    Add the cod and cook another 3 minutes; stir the potatoes into the mixture and cook another 1 to 2 minutes. 
    Reduce heat to low.</p>


<p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>

<p>Melt the butter in a separate pan over medium-low heat; vigorously stir the flour into the melted butter. 
    Slowly stream the hot milk into the mixture while stirring; cook and stir until thick. 
    Season with the nutmeg. Pour into the casserole with 1 1/3 cups cream; stir to coat. 
    Allow the mixture to simmer together for about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. 
    Drizzle remaining 2/3 cup cream over the mixture; sprinkle with the Parmesan cheese.</p>


<p><strong>Step 7</strong></p>

<p>Bake in the preheated oven until the top is browned, 30 to 40 minutes. Serve hot.</p>

<p><strong>Step 8</strong></p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
